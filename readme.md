# Redfollow - Simple tool to follow redirects
 
Redfollow is a simple tool to see where a URL goes following every redirect.

This tool is a work in progress and I plan to add some features to make it more useful. 

## Installation

To install Redfollow you can use ```go get```. 
```
$ go get github.com/josem/redfollow
```

## Usage 

```
$ redfollow http://github.com
```
